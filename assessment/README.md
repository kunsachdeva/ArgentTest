## How could you add authorization to this web-app, so only the wallet owner could lookup their data?
- Specific to Argent, we can ask user to enter addresses/ENS of all Guardians as a psuedo-KYC. 
- Metamask is widely accepted and also supports hardware wallets. We can use that verify the user.
- Alternatively, we can bypass it by asking seed phrase/private key from user and never storing or tranfering it.
